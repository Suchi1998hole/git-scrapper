# GitHub Trending Repository Analysis

This project analyzes trending repositories on GitHub, focusing on programming languages and fork counts. It provides insights into the popularity and engagement of different programming languages in the GitHub community.

## Project Overview

The project scrapes data from GitHub's trending page, collecting information on programming languages and fork counts for the most popular repositories. It then analyzes this data to reveal trends in language usage and community engagement.

## Key Findings

Based on the sample data:

1. **Top Languages**: The most prevalent languages in the trending repositories are:
   - Python
   - TypeScript
   - Jupyter Notebook

2. **Fork Counts**: Fork counts for top repositories range from 824 to 1806, indicating high levels of community interest and engagement.

3. **Python's Dominance**: Python appears multiple times in the top 5 repositories, showcasing its versatility and popularity across different types of projects.

4. **Web Development Trends**: The presence of TypeScript suggests a strong trend in modern web development projects.

5. **Data Science Popularity**: Jupyter Notebook's high ranking indicates the continued popularity of data science and analytical projects on GitHub.

## Methodology

- Data was collected using a custom web scraping function `scrape_github_trending_forks()`.
- The function scrapes GitHub's trending page for monthly trends, processing multiple pages of trending repositories.
- Information on programming languages and fork counts was extracted and analyzed.

## Limitations

- The analysis is based on trending repositories, which may not represent the entire GitHub ecosystem.
- Fork counts alone don't provide a complete picture of a repository's impact or quality.
- The trending algorithm's exact criteria are not public, which may introduce biases in the selection of repositories.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into current trends in the open-source community on GitHub. It highlights the languages and projects that are currently capturing the most attention and engagement, with Python, TypeScript, and Jupyter Notebook emerging as key players in the trending repository landscape.
